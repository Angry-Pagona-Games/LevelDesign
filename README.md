# Hi, I'm Sharroll! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Veteran, Full Sail University Alumni, and Level Designer. I put my game design career on hold just after graduation to return home and help out my mother. Now that I find myself in a position to return to the passion of games, I have decided to focus on creating new content and hopefully learning something new along the way.


## Lessons Learned

With each new map or series of works I aim to answer these questions:

What did you learn while building this project?
What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?



## Screenshots of my maps

Currently this is not a real screenshot, this is a place holder for future screenshots. Each screenshot with be accompanied by the Level Name and short synopsis of the level.
